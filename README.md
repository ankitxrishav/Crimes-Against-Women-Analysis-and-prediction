# Crimes Against Women Analysis and Predicition

##  Overview
This project analyzes crimes against women in India using statistical methods and machine learning. The dataset includes various crime categories such as **rape, kidnapping, dowry deaths, and domestic violence** across different states and districts from multiple years.

##  Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Data visualization and statistical insights.
- **Predictive Modeling:**
  - **Linear Regression:** Predicts trends in crime rates.
  - **LSTM Model:** Deep learning approach for time series forecasting.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Interactive Graphs & Insights:** Heatmaps, bar charts, line plots, and correlation analysis.

##  Dataset Details
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Source** https://www.ncrb.gov.in
- **STATE/UT, DISTRICT, Year** (Geographical and time-based information)
- **Crime Categories:** Rape, Kidnapping, Dowry Deaths, Domestic Violence, and more.

##  Results & Findings
- Identifies high-crime regions and trends over time.
- Predicts future crime rates using machine learning models.
- Highlights correlations between different crime categories.
